            <p>Welcome to my blog. You can read some things <a href="../about.html">about me</a> or choose a title from the list below that sounds relatable.</p>
<p>I try to write-up useful things I learn during my work. Usually journals of how I have worked or of something that has occurred. Aimed towards anybody who has a role in production in the software industry, i.e. developers, testers, management, communication, … I would also like to progess towards doing original research or rigourous reviews of existing research.</p>
<p>Also included are some accounts and essays inspired from my personal life. People who know me personally may find these interesting to read in order to understand my story.</p>
