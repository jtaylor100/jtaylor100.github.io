<p>Welcome to my blog. You can read <a href="../about.html">some things about me</a> or choose 
a title from the list below that sounds relatable.</p>

<p>I try to write-up useful things I learn during my work. Aimed towards anybody
who has a role in production in the software industry, i.e. developers, testers,
management, communication, ...</p>

<p>Also included are some musings and reflections on personal life
events. People who know me personally may find these interesting to read in
order to understand my story.</p>
