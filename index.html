	<h1>Planet of the Brains</h1>

	<p>Quite a while ago I watched the old 1960s version of "Planet of the Apes". Not the weird Tim Burton one done recently, this was the original in all of its glory. A crack team of make-up artists must've been kept very busy during most of its filming since, with no use of CGI whatsoever, some of the main characters had ape faces for the entire film. It must've also required some fairly hefty set building to make the ape village, although not that much since this was the age where Ben-Hur style sets were built for movies.</p>

	<p>One scene in the movie really stood out for me. It's where George Taylor, the main character, is taken to a Tribunal where the Apes are trying to discern his origin. On one side of the chamber are scientists defending Taylor's claims that he's from thousands of years in the past; both quite young but try to follow reason despite fearing being punished. The other side houses the aristocratic and much older noble Apes, the holders of superior knowledge. Often the scientists would press a point for the nobles to argue against, but the best thing that the nobles could come up with would be "that's heresy" or "this has been accepted as the case for years, therefore the opposite can't be true".</p>

	<p>Besides being an interesting scene it felt somewhat familiar to me. After thinking for some time I realised that in my brain I almost assemble a tribunal whenever I assess something. On one hand the thoughts of dissecting the subject with reason alone; the other hand where I try to draw from past experiences to try and make a conclusion about the subject. In simpler terms: the voice of reason and the voice of wisdom. Or, in the case of "Planet of the Apes", the young and Scientific vs the old and experienced.</p>

	<p>These different trails of thought aren't always in direct competition, quite often what I know is true based on past experience also makes sense when reasoning is applied to it. Yet they can conflict, and they do. When the thoughts produced by reason become scary, things such as "you have no free will" or "your life has no purpose", it can be quite comforting to let wisdom take over ("Of course you have free will, you've always had it", "Trying to find purpose in life is a stupid task, live your life instead"). Comforting, definitely, but I can never trust it 100 percent. Complete compliance with pre-conceived ideas is what caused the European mental slump in the dark ages, the Roman Catholic church kept a tight lock on the distribution and development of knowledge. Trusting wisdom all of the time would never allow me to learn anything new, even if the new things I am learning cause me great personal anxiety.</p>
