<h1 class="title">My Career Plan</h1>
<p class="date">2019-03-10</p>
</header>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A ‘career plan’ is really monumental thing. It’s like defining how
you want to spend 40% of your time in the next year. It affects all
areas of one’s life: who your friends are, what ideas you’re exposed to
and what you think about day-to-day. When viewed like this it seems like
a hopelessly huge decision to try and define statically. However I think
it’s worth doing.</p>
<p>As part of my studying of the ‘<a
href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/">80,000 Hours</a>’ career
guide, I was introduced to the idea of the ‘Planning Paradox’. The idea
that a plan will nearly always change before it’s implemented, due to a
changing environment. The world of work is always changing, so it seems
very applicable to this situation. However the guide suggests that,
despite this paradox, plans are still worth making. They can be a great
exercise in clarifying what exactly it is you’re aiming for. To have a
target without the pretense that it will never change.</p>
<p>Why make this public? Honesty is something that I <a
href="/values.html">highly value</a>, to be transparent in intentions.
So how much more transparent can you get with your career intentions
than posting the your plan online publicly? I hope that it will serve as
a useful reference for employers, co-workers and friends to know what
I’m aiming for. May it spawn conflicts of interest? Maybe. But I value
the transparency and freedom of information more than any hindrance it
may cause me.</p>
<p>I start by defining my current career options using a predefined
structure called the ‘A/B/Z’. Secondly I include a change log to provide
commentary as to how the options have changed over time.</p>
<h2 id="current-career-options">Current Career Options</h2>
<p>The A/B/Z is a set of three plans for how you can aim to develop your
career. It was created by Reid Hoffman in his book ‘<a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12030438-the-start-up-of-you">The
Startup of You</a>’, and suggested to me in the 80,000 Hours section on
career planning. Three plans are defined:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Plan A</dt>
<dd>
The Ideal Option, in the medium term<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
</dd>
<dt>Plan B</dt>
<dd>
A promising alternative. For when progress in Plan A becomes difficult.
</dd>
<dt>Plan Z</dt>
<dd>
A temporary fallback. For when all plans go ary and you need time to
think.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is a great structure since it can remind of secondary options in
case my current pursued career gets set back somehow. Say a risk I took
while executing Plan A failed and I found it hard to get jobs in Plan B,
I would always have a fallback option. Reminding myself of this makes
taking risks a little easier to stomach and helps get around some common
decision making problems (like not switching to a better option).
Provided are each of my choices for the plans and my justification.</p>
<h3 id="plan-a-the-ideal-option">Plan A — The Ideal Option</h3>
<p><em>Software Developer.</em> Through college and university this has
been the natural ending point of my education. Designing and developing
software, whether it is systems or application software. I currently
hold all of the necessary skills for this career and also have received
enough feedback to make me feel confident that I’m fairly good. It
provides many opportunities for creative problem solving and
flow-inducing work. There are many external benefits such as great work
environments, generous salaries and I feel like I fit into the culture
of software teams well. The major negative right now which may cause me
to revise this plan is the lack of positive social impact caused by the
building of software. This often makes my work feel meaningless, not
something particularly worth living for.</p>
<h3 id="plan-b-a-promising-alternative">Plan B — A Promising
Alternative</h3>
<p><em>Technical Writer.</em> This is the synthesis of two strong
interests of mine: technology and information codification. The latter
might be an odd phrase to you, so consider it as ‘appreciating the
creative communication of ideas’. This is something which I consider as
very powerful when done well. Knowledge sharing is extremely underrated
within business and can be carried out poorly, leading to communication
issues and potential organisational dysfunction. In this career I would
like to be dedicated to dealing with these issues head on. Improving the
internal education of a technology company’s own product and ensuring
that the most important information is reaching the right people at the
right times.</p>
<p>I received feedback from classmates at university that I had a great
way of explaining complex topics. Also, I have received complements for
small amounts of technical documentation written as a software
developer. These provide me with confidence that I would be well suited
to this position of communication through writing. A last tenuous
suggestion that I may fit in this field well is the large amount of
personal time I dedicate to reading<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<h3 id="plan-z-a-temporary-fallback">Plan Z — A Temporary Fallback</h3>
<p><em>Barge Maintenance.</em> I can rely on being able to go and work
with my Dad on restoring <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Lady_Daphne">his barge</a> and
making some money helping with tours. This is not ideal since it would
likely involve me to move to the barge from wherever I am living.
However I feel it is a safe guarantee of room and board, not to mention
the numerous benefits of being in the centre of London.</p>
<h2 id="change-log">Change Log</h2>
<p>To help keep track of how my career plan has evolved to its current
state, I will document the changes here and justifications for
these.</p>
<h3 id="march-2019">March 2019</h3>
<p>This is the initial version of the plan. Stating Software Developer,
Technical Writer and Barge maintenance as my A/B/Z. The purpose of this
was to write out my current career expectations before going ahead and
researching a load of alternatives that could provide more socially
impactful positions.</p>
