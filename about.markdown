title: About Josh
---


I am a software developer, recently graduated, trying to progress himself as a
professional. My personal technology interests lie in [functional
programming][] with languages such as [Lisp][] and [Haskell][].

![Me drinking some tea in [Hebden Bridge][], April 2018](/images/josh.png)

I was raised in [Barrington][], Cambridgeshire in the English countryside. My
ideal Saturday is enjoying a caffeinated breakfast with friends.

I try as best as I can to live consciously in line with my personal [values][].
I also try to keep a public [career plan][] up-to-date.
