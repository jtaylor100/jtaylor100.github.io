![Me drinking some tea in [Hebden Bridge][], April 2018](/images/josh.png)

*It is uncertain about what lies ahead, but that's the exciting part.*

I was raised in [Barrington][], Cambridgeshire in the English countryside. My
ideal Saturday is spending time with friends, relaxing with a good book or
trying out a new cake recipe.

I try to stay connected with my feelings. It helps to know what I truly [value][], what I want to [help][] during my life and [how][] I can do that.
