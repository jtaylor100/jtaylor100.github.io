title: About Josh

I am a software developer, recently graduated, trying to progress himself as a
professional. Also love listening to the Grateful Dead and Calvin Harris. My 
ideal downtime is a Sp√§tiwander or caffinated breakfast with friends.

# Strengths

When I filled in the [VIA survey on 'Character Strengths'][1], my top five strengths
came out as the following.

1. Love of Learning
2. Judgement
3. Fairness
4. Creativity 
5. Forgiveness

In my opinion they align quite well with reality. _Love of Learning_ having its
top spot is unquestionable, being a [philomath][2] has its benefits.
