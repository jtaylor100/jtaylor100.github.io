<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As part of my investigations carried out while creating my <a href="./career.html">career plan</a>, I wanted to identify some global social issues that I find particularly important. Clarifying these may reveal to me a more obvious personal mission to follow, providing a clear direction to search for more meaningful work.</p>
<p>The approach I took to searching was inspired by <em><a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a></em> in <a href="https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/">Part 5</a> of their online career guide. They provided three criteria for a good social problem to focus on solving. It should be a problem that is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Large in Scale.</li>
<li>Solvable.</li>
<li>Neglected.</li>
</ol>
<p>The organisation then goes to identify various global problems and rates them according to these criteria. These were a good starting point but were limited in quantity, and overtly focused reducing the effects of low-probability scenarios. It seemed possible that there could be better options out there. Perhaps not as sensationalist or popular as those posted by <em>80,000 Hours</em>, but still would provide a meaningful work mission. It also made sense to write the argument myself for each of the issues I identify, to make sure that I truly understand them and to provide opportunities for others to comment.</p>
<p>Therefore, here I shall write a section for each global issue which I personally find large in scale, solvable by a collective and neglected by larger society. I shall also consider for each how I could personally fit in the collective institutions that are working to tackle the problem.</p>
