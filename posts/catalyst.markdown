One of the books I could recommend to any software developer is '[The Pragmatic Programmer][]' by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. It's very different to lots of what engineers read in day-to-day work in my experience, kind of like a self-help book for software developers. A far cry from the typical heavily technical documentation, simplified 'how to' articles or informal stackoverflow answers which make up most of the research I do. I know I know, the phrase 'self-help book' also conjures cringey images in my head of smiling life coaches explaining their theory of how to live. The book is nowhere near this thankfully. All it does is simply states and explains many rules of thumb. Some are focused towards increasing productivity, some have more philisophical undertones, but many are all about trying to help you help the world in the best way as a developer.

Fortunately, being written by two accomplished developers[^1], the book is extremely well structured and the authors encapsulate[^2] the advise from each section into these tweet-sized 'tips' which are littered through the book. The '[List of Tips][]' on the book's website actually provide a really nice TLDR version.
