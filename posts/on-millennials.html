<p><em>This was an essay I wrote as part of an online course in essay
writing. I find the practice of essay writing incredibly useful for
forming stronger opinions. It is also a million miles away from the
regimented, dry and insufferable essay projects I was forced to complete
in school.</em></p>
<p>Commonly in the western world, “You don’t understand me!” is shouted
by teenagers at their parents. Their vague premise is excusable but
their feelings are genuine. New values, world views and beliefs are born
alongside each new generation, including the millennial generation.
People in the millennial generation and older generations share many of
the same values but in some ways they totally differ.</p>
<p>Firstly, the millennial generation prefers to keep things casual in
the office environment compared to older generations. This is evident in
the office fashions chosen by each generation. As offices around the
world are increasingly managed by the millennial generation, a trend of
a more casual office clothing is apparent in the west. An office
requiring strictly formal wear all of the time is slowly becoming a
thing of the past and is becoming a rule only consistently found at
formalised institutions, such as banks. The older generations also
prescribed a more formal style of speaking in the office environment
compared to the offices of today. In the past, bosses had to be
addressed with high respect and observance of their authority. Whereas
today employees are able to have a more relaxed relationship with their
management. Continuous communication of feedback and transparency is
valued over holding one’s tongue through fear of breaking the rules. The
office environment, for better or worse, has changed to reflect the more
casual attitude of millennials.</p>
<p>Secondly, the traditional religious world view of previous
generations has not persisted within the millennial generation. This is
corroborated by the number of people in the millennial generation that
are currently identifying as being part of a religion. The <a
href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/ethnicityandreligionbyage">2011
Census in the UK</a> allowed each participant to state a religion with
which they identified. Between the ages of 15 and 29, the approximate
age range of the millennial generation in 2011, 3 out of 5 participants
identified with a particular religion. The older bracket of
participants, those aged 30 or higher, showed a more pious ratio of 4
out of every 5 participants. The more secular world view of millennials
can also be seen in the rising interest in astrology within the
generation. Many would agree that there is a high frequency of
conversation heard amongst millennials about star-sign personality
traits. Spiritual guidance was never a monopoly held by priests or
sheikhs, but this trend suggests astrology is increasingly substituting
them. Within the broader trend of secularization in western culture, it
is no surprise that millennials are opting for a more secular way of
life compared to those before.</p>
<p>Finally, millennials have more accepting attitudes towards emotions
compared with older generations. Older generations tend to cope with
their own emotions through avoidance, suppression and self-argument.
This is quite succinctly expressed in the commonly heard phrase “Pull
yourself together!” which implies that a person should control their own
emotions in all circumstances. This likely has roots in the older
generation’s immediate parents from the early 20th century, when
emotional self-control was seen as an exceedingly important virtue. In
contrast, millennials often favour feeling emotions over controlling
them. Instead of trying to get past emotions, a millennial will analyse
them and reflect upon them. Perhaps this could be motivated by an
underlying belief that to turn away from one’s emotions would be to
neglect a large part of one’s self. Each generation has had to find
their own way to deal with emotions in their immediate context; in
today’s context millennials find acceptance to be the preferable
strategy.</p>
<p>In summary, there are aspects of millennials that differ in the
contexts of work, world view and coping with everyday life. As the
millennial generation matures into positions of power, these differences
shall become ever more important to focus on as the generation shapes
the society we live in.</p>
