        <p>Drugs are awesome, am I right? Not the kind that you get from that shady guy from the street corner, I'm talking more of the legal kind. Alcohol, coffee, <a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/on-taking-drugs/">even things like buttered</a> toast and freshly squeezed orange juice count. The definition is actually quite lenient.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drug, noun: A chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being&quot; is probably the most vague part of the definition since, technically, anything you ingest is a chemical substance. Some even take the definition further, suggesting that things we observe or hear could even count as drugs too. Imagine if you walked into the doctors saying that you were feeling depressed and he prescribed a few albums of the Beatles to get you feeling better.</p>
<p>It seems like a strange thing, but this is how most people deal with the struggles of their daily lives. Not feeling mentally great? Make a cup of tea and snuggle up with your loved one. Does this count as a drug? That's questionable, but does it almost always work well? Almost always, at least for me anyway.</p>
<p>The real struggle is getting the balance right, the correct doses of drugs at the right times of day. I love coffee, but I hate the feeling when you've drunk too much. I also love alcohol, but some of the worst decisions I've ever made have been whilst I've been drinking too much. Just because there are downsides, it doesn't make sense to give both of these important drugs up for good. What does make sense however is finding out how they work best for you or for me or for the person you're offering them to.</p>
