I had an extremely interesting rant with someone I hadn't spoken to in years.
Surprisingly it didn't take place in a comment section and neither of us ever
resorted to name calling. It went something like this.

<div class="conversation">

What would your ideal life look like?

Not sure, but I want it to be meaningful to me, aligned with personal values I
guess

Hmm, so like getting a high status job and working towards financial security?

I don't find those things very meaningful tbh. I guess they're things that
society values and encourages but they don't inspire me much 

What? Aren't those things objectively good for any person in their lives?

Only if you value them personally. If society expects you to get a good job
then it can feel like the same sometimes

But even if you don't value them intrinsically, they still lead to great things
like all the cool parties.

So what if I don't care about parties? 

</div>


It carried on like this for a while. It was quite hard for me to explain to
him that society's values aren't my values. The belief that status, power and money
leads to general happiness has always seemed misconceived to me. Also a little 
old-fashioned. 

Why is this? It's easier to explain with pictures.

This is the traditional view of how money relates to happiness: a straight line.
