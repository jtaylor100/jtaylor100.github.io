<h1 class="title">On Inevitable Exploitation</h1>

<p>Exploitation has been a persistent issue throughout human history,
leaving a lasting impact on societies. It raises the question: Is
exploitation an inherent part of civilisation? As we’ve progressed over
time, has only the focus of exploitation changed?</p>
<p>When we consider the origins of widespread exploitation like slavery
or wage labor, we may wonder with exasperation if there was a time
before it existed. Throughout history, societies have oppressed certain
individuals or groups to benefit others, although the methods and
targets have varied.</p>
<p>In today’s society, exploitation operates differently. Instead of
relying on force and punishment, modern systems like capitalism use
incentives. Capitalists and landowners hold the rewards, enticing people
to work for personal gain. This system allows for some social mobility,
education, and self-improvement.</p>
<p>Capitalism, despite its flaws, offers opportunities for change
because people are becoming more educated and aware. This opens up the
possibility of collectively managing our affairs, reducing the control
exerted by the capitalist class. Socialism challenges existing power
structures by emphasising social ownership and democratic control of
resources. However the question remains: Who would hold the rewards, and
therefore the power, in a socialist society?</p>
<p>The short answer is: we don’t know yet, but some ideas exist.
Socialism is often seen as an alternative to capitalism, but it doesn’t
necessarily represent a final solution. It is more like a transformative
change aiming to create a fairer society. The outcome of such
transformations is uncertain, with different visions and interpretations
of socialism. So far, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism">state socialism</a>
has been the only observed outcome of successful socialist change.
However, it is mostly viewed very unfavourably in the West, as it has
resulted in situations where all the rewards and means of punishment end
up benefiting a group of corrupt political elites. Therefore, we should
consider alternative approaches to state socialism.</p>
<p>Various alternative models have been proposed to transform society
while addressing concerns of authoritarianism and power concentration.
Examples include <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">libertarian
socialism</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a>,
and decentralised or non-hierarchical systems that prioritise individual
autonomy and participation. Perhaps within these models lies the end of
mass exploitation as we know it.</p>
<p>Exploitation, in some form, has persisted throughout human history.
However, as civilisation has evolved, the dynamics of exploitation have
shifted from traditional slavery to subtler control mechanisms like
capitalism. Nevertheless, the potential for change remains, especially
with movements like socialism that challenge existing power structures.
It’s important to understand that socialism is not a fixed end state,
but rather a stepping stone towards greater justice and equality. By
exploring alternative approaches to state socialism, we can enrich the
discussion and pave the way for new possibilities in shaping our
collective future.</p>
