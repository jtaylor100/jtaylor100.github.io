<h1 class="title">On Employment and Personal Identity</h1>
<p class="date">2020-11-10</p>
</header>
<p>Multiple teachers, careers advisors and parents often ask children in
schools: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” It is a question for
which few children can give a sure answer to, however the question is
interesting because of its use of language. The question is rarely “How
do you want to make a living?” but it specifically asks what the child
wants <em>to be</em>. Although perhaps not intentionally, the adults in
this situation are asking a child about their future personal identity
while stressing their employment as a key part of this identity.
However, nobody should be encouraged to make their employment part of
their personal identity.</p>
<p>Before diving into this claim, it should be established first what
<em>personal identity</em> and <em>employment</em> mean. Questions of
personal identity can be asked in <a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/">many
directions</a>. However in this case the definition taken will be: the
various aspects that make a person themselves. Put in another way,
personal identity is the collection of answers somebody gives when
responding to the question: “Who are you?” They are the aspects that are
accompanied with feelings of attachment, pride or ownership. They may
also be linked to a wilfulness to preserve such aspects. Examples of
these answers may be: “I am a happy person”, “I am sporty”, and “I am
chunky”; or in a negated form “I am not violent” and “I am never a
liar”. When a person has a clear picture in their mind of what these
aspects are then it gives that person a sense of integrity and
self-consistency. The absence or confusion of these aspects is also
known as an ‘identity crisis’, a psychological phenomenon experienced by
most people as they develop through the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson&#39;s_stages_of_psychosocial_development">stages
of adolescence</a>. Nevertheless the definition of personal identity is
incredibly nuanced and can mean various different things to different
people, at least in comparison to the definition of employment.
Employment is the state of a person being engaged by another on a
permanent basis to complete tasks in return for resources. People are
described as having employment or being employed. When one makes their
employment part of their identity, then when asked “Who are you?” she
shall reply “I am a baker” or “I am a lawyer” and have some ownership of
this aspect of themselves. With both terms now defined, it may now be
seen what arguments can be made against their integration.</p>
<p>Firstly, since employment requires doing tasks for other people, it
will always require a person to make compromises which may conflict with
other aspects of her personal identity. A key part of employment is that
employees are engaged by some <em>others</em>, whether by a single
private owner or a collective of shareholders. To put it simply, these
<em>others</em> call all the shots. As an employee, a person’s role
isn’t to exercise their will freely but to remained aligned with the
organization which usually moves to achieve the will of the
<em>others</em>. The relationship here between business owners and
workers has been recognized for generations and is not anything new.
However problems can begin to arise when an employee has made their role
part of their identity but are then forced to take an action which feels
like a violation of their identity. Take a situation where a person, for
the sake of example called Annie, is proud to be a carpenter and
considers it a key part of herself. Annie considers part of who she is
as: somebody who takes wood and makes beautiful or useful items. She
also considers herself a compassionate person towards animals, showing
this through work in her free time caring for rescued animals and
adopting a vegetarian diet. Given these parts of Annie’s personal
identity, lastly consider an order she has to fulfil in her workshop to
create animal enclosures for a meat production plant. To add more
context, the order is quite critical in allowing the workshop to stay
afloat and keep carpenters like Annie employed. She has a family to
support and the workshop sees no other customers on the horizon. What
choices are available to her? She may resist the order, risking her job
in the best case or bankrupting the company in the worst case; this
leaves the well-being of herself and her family at risk. Alternatively
she may begrudgingly carry out the order and emotionally digest what she
sees as an ethical violation. A less extreme example may be to consider
a professor working at a university. She considers herself to be a
successful academic and also a creator of new knowledge, the second
aspect being supported by the first. However over time her work
situation changes, requiring more political manoeuvrers within her
institution to maintain her position there. Again, to add more context,
her field is very specialized and the chances of her obtaining an
academic position at another institution is low. In this case our
professor may also feel trapped in a forced choice between rescinding
her role as an academic or continuing to politically maneuver instead of
spending her work time doing what she values, essentially a choice
between which aspect of her identity to abandon. Though one may have an
opinion over which choices in the examples the actors should take, every
choice has a shared property which is a high chance of an identity
crisis occurring. When given these tough choices a person like Annie,
the professor or any person in this situation may start to seriously
question their lives or who they are, causing great emotional stress.
The outcome of such a crisis will often be to distance oneself from
their employment or ignite a large change in life goals. The former is
more common and realistic given the disposition in western society to
highly value the desires and goals of individuals, or in simpler words
for individuals to value life over work when they come into conflict. So
if a distancing from work is in many cases likely, then it may be seen
as wise to pre-emptively distance oneself from one’s work in order to
avoid the mentioned identity crisis.</p>
<p>An argument against a person distancing herself from her employment
is that she will spend a large portion of her life in work, so to
consider employment as irrelevant to who she is would be a pessimistic
outlook on her life, but this is not necessarily true. It is true that a
majority of us will spend a large portion of our lives in employment.
Karl Thompson, a sociology blogger, calculates with UK national
statistics that over a typical lifespan of 76 years the average adult
will spend <a
href="https://revisesociology.com/2016/08/16/percentage-life-work/">23%
of their life</a> in paid employment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/life-proportion.svg"
alt="Graphic showing the proportion of life spent in employment" /><br />
</p>
<p>Alongside this, there is a popular belief that if a person spends
lots of time doing something then that activity should be something
valuable to her, however the realism of this ideal varies from person to
person based on their own personal situation. The origins of this belief
may lie in the tendency treat time as a resource, made most obvious
whenever a person talks about “spending time”. While using a resource,
it is a common preference to use it efficiently which results in the
principle to ‘spend time well’. To use time efficiently in this sense
would be for a person to allocate as much time as possible connected to
something they find authentically meaningful. However maximising time
efficiency in this way is not always the best path for a person to find
their life valuable as a whole. For an example, a person named James may
find that a valuable use of his time is in social efforts to help
recovering heroin addicts. James’ upbringing did not provide him with
the privilege to gain many qualifications in this area easily and allow
him to connect his values to his employment. So James takes up a day job
working in administration at an accounting company while volunteering
his free time to pursue his values. In this case, for James to have the
most fulfilling life the best option for him is to ‘waste’ lots of his
time supporting himself and then using his remaining time connecting to
something he values. It may appear as a compromising outcome but the
reality is that most people, like James, are to a certain extent bound
to some limitations due to their personal history or background. For a
person to choose the best option for themselves is not equivalent to
being pessimistic. So to view our employment as something remote from
ourselves, despite spending a large portion of time on it, is not
necessarily a pessimistic outlook on our lives.</p>
<p>One final point addresses how pressures from society can persuade
people to make employment part of their identity, discouraging them to
form an authentic identity independently. There are multiple examples of
how society encourages individuals to consider employment part of their
personal identity. Perhaps the largest of these is to be found in the
United States as an interpretation of the American dream, which ties
into the national identity of the USA. A main theme of the dream is the
promise that any person, regardless of background, can gain prosperity
to themselves but only in return for full dedication to their work.</p>
<p><img src="/images/going-up-or-down.jpg"
alt="“Going up or down?”: An advertisement from an old American magazine" /><br />
</p>
<p>The strong belief and re-interpretation of this principle in American
culture culminated in many Americans seeing their employment as a key
way to measure themselves within society. It then inevitably became a
strongly developed part of the average person’s identity. Other examples
of such societal pressures come in the form of propaganda and
motivational media. Historically during wars, all countries tend to
appeal to people’s emotions to drive up their productivity without
expending additional resources. This resulted in much media associating
employment with pride and valuable personal characteristics, in many
cases even duty. This again caused many to judge themselves based upon
their position of employment and therefore see it as a key part of
themselves.</p>
<p><img src="/images/josies.png"
alt="Although great symbols of female empowerment, the ‘Josie’ characters on American and Chinese propoganda posters were likely made to increase worker productivity." /><br />
</p>
<p>This practice of appealing to a person’s personal identity to improve
productivity continues today, although in a reduced form, by states and
private companies in the form of motivational media. The main takeaway
from these examples is how in each case people are not encouraged to
think about who they want to be but are instead told who they should be,
which if accepted without critique could cause a person to create an
inauthentic identity for themselves. If one believes that a person
should have agency and freedom over their lives, then their construction
of who they are should also be done with agency and freedom based on
values they consciously establish instead of being passively
assimilated. So if a person wishes to remain authentic to themselves,
they must form their identity based on values they hold instead of
appealing to society’s values; this includes values around
employment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a person should not be pressured to consider her
employment as an area of her personal identity. Without this pressure, a
person may enter employment with well tuned expectations of what they
are there for: to earn a means to live. So while asking a child “What do
you want to be when you grow up?”, an adult should appreciate that they
are re-enforcing this pressure and they should remain mindful of the
consequences it can have.</p>
