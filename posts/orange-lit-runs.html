        <p>All in all I've been very lucky. I've never had any truly horrific actual physical events to deal with, but my brain has a habit of creating trouble, especially if there is very little of it around. It could come in the form of anxiety, suspicions, a very strong desire to be cold about things or just a silent numbness. The worst experiences I've had with this are now just foreign memories to me. Some have stuck though and revisit me occasionally.</p>
<p>The majority of these experiences happened whilst at my sixth form college, Hills Road. Not to bring a bad reputation to the place, it is genuinely quite a pleasant institution. Lots of people go through there every year finding it a great place to study, some of my friends even claiming after leaving that &quot;The Hills Road dream will never die&quot; whatever that means. Roger Waters from Pink Floyd went there when it was still the Cambridge High School for Boys. He didn't have the best experience there and he developed a great opposition against the education system â€” prompting his writing of the Chart topping song &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;. Like Waters, I found it hard enjoy the place in many ways. Always managed to make me feel inferior, even after I gave my greatest efforts towards things.</p>
<p>During the early winter of '13, I'm not sure what quite came over me but I suddenly decided that I needed to run. Even as the pavements were frosted over and I needed to be in college at 9:00am everyday after leaving my house at 7:20am. So I started sleeping in early, wound my alarm slowly back to 5:00am, rolled out of bed, pulled on a pair of tracksuits and a sweater and ran into the 3 degrees morning.</p>
<p>It was cold, slippery, silent except for the wind and the sky was black with clouds. I could see fairly well, my home village lit up in orange by the old street lamps. With an old pair of headphones in the garage I started to run with all the effort I had. Now this may seem extremely normal for the average Hills student at the time, all probably got regular exercise in their local gym early in the morning and collapsed in their central Cambridge flat which their fucking rich parents paid for outright. Exercise is good for the mind and good for confidence right?</p>
<p>Suffice to say that I wasn't running for any of those things, nor had I ever really ran at length ever before in my life. I had gone through my entire childhood without playing sports or taking part in athletics; if I ever attempted playing then I would lose and feel mocked. As a result, running is terrifying to me especially in public, even today. The only place where I could build up courage to do it was my home town at 5 in the morning, when it was freezing cold so nobody would be out. Even then I was still terrified, occasionally sitting down on the ground and breathing hysterically, due to both a lack of fitness and the terror of what I was doing. Quite often I would have tears on my face even though it never felt like I was crying.</p>
<p>During this phase time of running, I found Hills Road much easier to live with. My grades went up and I felt more confident in what I did and how I acted. The only visible effect of what I was doing in the mornings was that my voice grew very hoarse, from the constant breathing of cold air. Nobody knew what was going on, my family just thought I was trying to exercise. I didn't know what was going on but it helped. Slowly thought it became harder and harder to keep going, I would arrive at the College social area in the morning and feel exhausted. Exhausted in the body but much more so in the mind. Stopping after 3 weeks was a difficult thing to do but ultimately it was the right thing, I would return to my dissatisfied ways at College and but in return I didn't have to face my biggest fears first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>It might seem quite strange and pathetic to lots of people to have a fear of running or taking part. To me it feels quite natural somehow and I'm not sure if it's something permanent or if it will fade with time.</p>
