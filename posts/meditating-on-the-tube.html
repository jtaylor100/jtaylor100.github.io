<!-- Thesis: I find London tricky to live in because it demands a level of
stimulation that I find uncomfortable -->

</p>
<p>After spending time in London, you will likely hear the phrase:
“tired of London, tired of life”. The phrase dates back to Samuel
Johnson, the author of the first dictionary ever written who lived in
London. Although I doubt we should be taking life advice from a
dictionary writer, which sounds like the very definition of a tiring
life, the phrase has struck a chord with many. Yet the saying has always
vexed me. While living here I have found many of my experiences
incredibly tiring and I don’t believe it is because I have given up on
my life. It’s just that London demands a level of stimulation that many
find uncomfortable, including me.</p>
<p>Let’s take a very common experience shared by anyone who has lived in
or visited London: riding the tube. I have often imagined that if hell
has a sound it would be close to the screeching and roaring heard on the
Jubilee line between Green Park and Westminister. While riding on that
stretch, I see each person putting on a stoic expression as
conversations are extinguished and ears are plugged. This experience is
common all over the tube network. Sudden sounds can bleat at you through
the endless hamster-cage tunnels. It’s hardly pleasant and causes my
whole body to clench, like it needs to run away.</p>
<p>It was manageable to start with but it started to wear me down. I saw
signs of this in others too, where many sitting opposite would close
their eyes or bury themselves in games and music. I soon found myself
joining them in trying to cut myself off from the stimulating
environment but it always left me feeling anxious afterwards just the
same. The only solace I was able to find on my journeys was to meditate
on the tube. I spent journeys totally concentrated on my body. I
observed in detail how I contracted and reacted in step with the tube’s
hellish soundscape and erratic motion. Through this I could regain some
safe ground and expand my tolerance for it all. Unfortunately this is
not the only situation where tolerance needed to be built in London. It
turns out that everywhere is subtly like the tube.</p>
<p>The people of London are unique in that they are so diverse yet all
share a common value of ecstasy. I mean ‘ecstasy’ here not as the drug
enjoyed by dopamine fiends everywhere. I mean it as the mental state
marked by the moments in our lives where a surreal level of happiness or
enjoyment is reached. Think of: a surprise party, seeing a favourite
band, tasting a gourmet meal or being applauded by a crowd. Of the many
people I have met in London, those who loved the city and seemed the fit
in the most were all direct seekers of ecstasy. They were serial
planners with calendars filled to burst. Always building up to a next
big achievement while heading off to lengthy parties on the weekend.
‘Work hard, play hard’ was common, known less romantically as ‘burning
the candle at both ends’. This shared value creates the buzz of the
city. Some may find it endearing and exciting; yet I only find it
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear somebody say ‘tired of London, tired of life’ I
usually have a fleeting moment of asking myself ‘am I boring person?’
Yet this is an absurd conclusion. As we go through life, we each grow an
idea of what a valuable life looks like. There is no one right or
essential answer to the question ‘what is a valuable life?’ So just
because my view of a valuable life is not aligned with the normal London
experience, it does not mean that I need to change or I have poor taste.
In fact it a helpful indicator that London is not a place where I want
to put down roots or commitments. Ironically it means that if I am
currently feeling tired of life, then I am probably tired of London.</p>
