by  making decisions to complete a chosen personal mission, treated as a
meaning to life (existentialism).

At the end of the film *Titanic* one of the final shots is where a camera pans
over Rose's picture frames to show how rich her life had been despite living
through the disaster. Her pictures showed scenes such as her riding a horse,
flying in an aeroplane and having calm days with her family. For the many who
have watched it, the scene can be quite touching. However one interesting thing
about the photographs was that they all showed scenes of Rose in her leisure
time, time spent in the pursuit of enjoyment, which implied that these were the
most valuable experiences of her life. There was no celebration of anything
that Rose had achieved or changed within the world, only what she had enjoyed.
This situation hardly seems radical and reflects perhaps one of the most common
views of life that is encountered in western individuals: leisurism. Leisurism
is a lifestyle where an individual directs most personal decisions in their
lives around maximising the quality of their leisure.
