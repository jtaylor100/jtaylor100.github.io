<h1 class="title">Profoundly Immoral and Wicked</h1>
<p class="date">2016-02-18</p>
</header>
<p>I had never once considered what it meant to be ‘evil’ until very
recently. It wasn’t something I ever considered to be debatable; good
was good, evil was evil. Watching enough Tarantino films brought the
possibility that everybody was evil in some way, but they never caused
me to ask “what makes them evil?”</p>
<h2 id="knowing-youre-doing-wrong">Knowing you’re doing wrong</h2>
<p>Let’s assume that good or evil is defined by your actions, ignore
good/evil aspects of thought for the time being. The line that must be
drawn first is one between those who cause pain but do not realise it
and those who realise they are causing damage but continue anyway.
Ignorant causers of pain can not be labelled as evil, as far as I
believe; it is the intent of causing damage which defines somebody as
being evil.</p>
<p>Consider a fireplace in a campsite. The fire can burn those around
it, but it seems illogical to point at the fire and shout “evil!” It is
just a natural thing. Now consider a person or other animal picked up a
stick set alight by the fire, dropping the stick in range of one of the
tents. Could this be a concrete example of evil? Not really, the carrier
of the stick may have no intent of burning the campsite. The intent of
the carrier is what separates the evil action from the act of
ignorance.</p>
<h2 id="causing-harm-without-having-an-end">Causing harm without having
an end</h2>
<p>There are many examples in history however where causing pain with
intent has been viewed as “good” by many people. Wars, genocide,
prisoner torture: all seen as “necessary” actions at some point or
another, acts supposedly working towards a common good. While all were
causers of unimaginable pain and suffering, both physically and
mentally, it can be disturbingly easy to put yourself in the position of
the torturer and see yourself as just. What brings that sense of
Justice? The torturer can point to a reason why they are causing the
pain, a reason that will contribute more to the common good and redeems
the pain caused.</p>
<p>Regardless of the validity the torturer’s reason has, can they really
be pinned down as being truly evil? That is questionable, but if the
answer were no then the only evil actions in the world would be those
committed by a Sadist. Those that cause pain without any reason but with
intent. It’s difficult to find examples of these people since
descriptions of their acts can always be spun to have some kind of
reason. A school yard bully comes to mind, not stealing money or trying
to gain social prestige, but just enjoying the act of humiliating
others. An act of rape could be another example, of a man not trying to
satisfy his personal urges, but enjoys more the shame he is inflicting
on his victim. This I find is the true essence of evil.</p>
<h2 id="looking-to-google">Looking to Google</h2>
<p>The top definition for evil on Google is ‘profoundly immoral and
wicked’ <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. This suggests that evil is a very
flexible term, that there is no true concrete example of evil, since
morality is itself flexible from person to person. A democratic approach
could be taken to define something as evil. If the majority of people
believe that a person’s actions are completely immoral then they are by
definition evil. This seems to be a popular opinion of what evil is
since it doesn’t excuse the actions of the immoral even if they intend
to be moral, however it is completely objective and the validity of the
opinion is based on how many people are on the accuser’s side.</p>
<p>It can be thought that these days, in order to be evil, you need to
be up against a crowd of people sharpening their pitchforks. If no crowd
ever appears then you can’t possibly be evil. People can believe this as
their ignorant actions harm the lives of countless others in small ways.
An example of this was pointed out in a very <a
href="http://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm">excellent
talk by Maciej Cegłowski</a>, which is transcribed online. In the latter
part of his talk he looks to silicon valley, where money is thrown from
venture to venture in an endless competition for prestige. All the
meanwhile the homeless population of San Francisco is rising every year
<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. While millions and potentially
billions of dollars are thrown on grand projects in the area such as
space programs, human immortality and smartphone apps; people are
struggling to gather ten dollars while living on the streets. In this
modern world these projects may never be defined as evil. Who doesn’t
like space programs? As long as people do enjoy these grand projects,
the mob of pitchforks won’t appear and the venture capitalists will
continue to operate, believing that their actions benefit mankind.</p>
<p>Even then, going back to my earlier definition of evil, they aren’t
sadists. They don’t want to cause pain and if pinned to the ground they
would never say that they don’t care about homelessness. Are they just
simply ignorant of how much benefit they could give? Am I ignorant to
the importance of their projects?</p>
<h2 id="personal-conflict">Personal Conflict</h2>
<p>So are evil people sadistic, immoral or just ignorant? Or could they
perhaps be a combination of the three? Saying that people are only evil
if they are sadistic is too strict I find. This excuses about 80% of
modern cases of evil and still leaves that remaining 20% on questionable
terms. Immorality is the other extreme, it is too loosely defined and
could be pinned on anybody in a variety of situations. Ignorance with
power and a weakness for personal gains gives rise to what we currently
see in silicon valley; but even as it pains people can it really be
evil?</p>
<p>It just gives rise to a big personal conflict, and makes me wonder if
evil exists at all? Could it not just be something planted in me as a
child? Perhaps all people that are seen as evil were just misguided in
intricate ways. Perhaps it isn’t something worth thinking about too
much.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I find the use of the word “wicked” in this definition
quite funny, since the top Google definition for wicked is “evil or
morally wrong”. I thought recursive definitions were only something that
existed in code. The second definition of evil I find is surprisingly
“extremely unpleasant”, like an unpleasant sight or smell. I have never
heard the word used in this way, “the smell of that fish is quite evil”
just sound bazaar.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
