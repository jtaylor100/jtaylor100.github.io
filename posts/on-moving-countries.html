<p>Truly, tourism is shallow. It’s not worth trying to deny it. Whilst
on a sight-seeing holiday, we float into a foreign or distant land to
gawp at something novel. Then as soon as the typical weekend break or
week-long tour is over we return; perhaps with some memories but
ultimately with a superficial impression of the place that we had just
encountered. The only way to get a meaningful impression from another
country is to live there and immerse oneself in the everyday bustle of
life. However getting this impression isn’t the only effect one may
experience after moving to a different country. Moving countries is a
life pivoting experience and may affect a number of changes within
oneself.</p>
<p>To begin with, living in a different country builds an appreciation
of different cultures. This appreciation can be strengthened when one
learns how the values of another culture differ from one’s home culture.
For example, in countries such as England or Spain there is a high value
placed on manners in conversation which may discourage people from
giving honest opinions. In contrast to England and Spain are countries
such as Germany or Israel, stereotypically known for being ‘direct’ in
conversation, where a higher value is placed upon sincerity and honestly
over manners. An appreciation of different cultures may also arise from
direct observation of the cultural rituals performed which may only be
encountered after spending an extended time within that culture. While
visiting Sweden one may see beautiful scenery and neat towns but after
living in the country for some time and establishing a social life one
may be able to participate in the Swedish ritual of fika. This involves
a relaxed gathering of friends to enjoy pastry and coffee together. The
ritual of observing name days in various European countries is also an
interesting aspect of their cultures. In Hungary for example a person’s
name day is less significant than a birthday but that person will often
receive a gift; women tend to receive flowers and men a bottle of
alcohol. Noticing the combination of all these differences in culture
can develop this strong appreciation.</p>
<p>Secondly, living in a different country allows a person to develop
their own personal independence. For many who move country, it is the
furthest away they will have lived from their childhood community. This
distance demands more independent thought and action from the person,
who may require some growing in order to meet that demand. However the
distance can also emancipate that person from their past. In an
environment away from established family and friends, a person can
develop a stronger sense of independent self in a new environment with
new people. Even the process of making new friends in a foreign land can
strengthen one’s independence. In order to build a social life from the
ground up, it is often necessary to be very proactive at the start with
meeting new people. For people who feel a little shy, the behaviour
required may appear to border on invasiveness. Having this proactivity
requires personal drive and a realisation that the situation will not
change passively. What’s more, after building a first network from the
ground up, one will feel far more comfortable with the idea of doing it
again. This is because the proactivity developed from the first move
will feel far more natural since it has been exercised before. This
lasting proactivity is certain to leave any person acting and thinking
far more independently.</p>
<p>Lastly, perhaps most importantly, living in a different country makes
it easy for a person to build international friendships with some truly
excellent people. Other countries will often contain people who are very
different from oneself who can bring novel perspectives to
conversations. For example, while reflecting over political issues
within one’s home country one may reframe the issues in a less dreary
light after hearing an international friend describing their own
country’s polticial issues. Another example links back to an earlier
point about appreciating a culture’s different values, where a friend
may act in a way which feels strange but may actually compliment well
with oneself in the situation. Much like how in relationships different
aspects of ourselves can align and compliment with another person,
cultural aspects can also align and compliment within groups of people.
Different countries will also contain people similar to oneself, expats,
who one may find common ground with easily. To be an expat nearly always
comes with an attitude of adventure and an openness to new experiences.
One may find expats to be excellent companions while travelling and
perhaps even for life! The many people who one meets while living in a
different country can remain valuable contacts even after one has moved
away. They may be able to provide company while travelling back to the
area or opportunities for work. They may even be able to put you up for
a night. Overall, the value in having international friendships is great
and there is no better way to establish many than by living abroad
within an international community.</p>
<p>In summary, moving countries is clearly a momentous life experience.
It provides one with a rich feeling of other cultures, fosters
independence within ourselves and establishes some of the most valuable
relationships in our lives. No matter at which junction a person is in
life, they have the choice to launch this adventure at any time. If a
person has enthusiasm is there and can make it practically work, then
they should undoubtedly go for it.</p>
