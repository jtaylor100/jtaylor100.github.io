I believe filtering information is a crucial part of my daily work. I get paid
to go through a lot of information and find the small but important details
that can make a real difference. These details could be considered knowledge,
which means useful information for my current task. After I find and act on
this knowledge, I often think about what I've done. These thoughts lead me to
explore the differences between information, knowledge, and wisdom.

What makes information different from knowledge? It's all about how
useful it is in the specific problem we're dealing with.

An excellent example of this difference is found in Dan Kahneman's book,
'[Thinking, Fast and
Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow).' In
the beginning of the book, Kahneman admits that the information he presents
might not be very helpful for making personal decisions. Instead, he offers it
as a way to indirectly evaluate how others make decisions. He honestly says
that if someone is reading the book solely for personal growth, they won't gain
any knowledge as we define it. Yet, the book is still considered a self-help
masterpiece.

But, if knowledge is useful information, what distinguishes it from true
wisdom? It's all about how applicable it is. Knowledge only becomes wisdom when
it's skilfully used in real-life situations. Or alternatively: when knowledge
becomes embodied within our actions.

Let's take baking as an example. A recipe is a clear guide that helps
us bake and gain culinary expertise. In this case, we can easily apply
knowledge from a recipe to learn the skill of baking. By my definition, it
wouldn't be too far off to say that recipe books, along with
[checklists](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_19)
and other instructional texts, are some of the wisest resources for beginners
in a skill. This idea lines up with the [Dreyfus
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) of
skill acquisition, which says that beginners need constant procedural guidance
to take their first steps.

However, in certain fields, directly applying knowledge takes a lot of
effort. This is often because chances to use that knowledge might not
come up often. In these cases, it's crucial to memorise the knowledge
so we can quickly access it when we need it. Medicine is a perfect
example, as doctors must recall and put together a lot of information
rapidly to diagnose and treat patients effectively. Similarly, skills
related to relationships or mental health often require immediate use in
unexpected situations, emphasising the need for quick recall and
application.

In conclusion, the process of filtering information, extracting
knowledge, and applying it skilfully is vital in developing the many
life skills we need. By following the journey from information to wisdom
through thoughtful reflection and deliberate practice, we can navigate
complex challenges and grow our ability to cope in the world.
