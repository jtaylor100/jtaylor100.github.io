title: Important Global Issues

## Introduction

As part of my investigations carried out while creating my [career
plan](/career.html), I wanted to identify some global social issues that I find
particularly important. Clarifying these may reveal to me a more obvious
personal mission to follow, providing a clear direction to search for more
meaningful work.

The approach I took to searching was inspired by _[80,000 Hours][]_ in [Part 5][]
of their online career guide. They provided three criteria for a good social
problem to focus on solving. It should be a problem that is:

1. Large in Scale.
2. Solvable.
3. Neglected.

The organisation then goes to identify various global problems and rates them
according to these criteria. These were a good starting point but were
limited in quantity, and overtly focused reducing the effects of
low-probability scenarios. It seemed possible that there could be better
options out there. Perhaps not as sensationalist or popular as those posted by
_80,000 Hours_, but still would provide a meaningful work mission. It also made
sense to write the argument myself for each of the issues I identify, to make
sure that I truly understand them and to provide opportunities for others to
comment.

Therefore, here I shall write a section for each global issue which
I personally find large in scale, solvable by a collective and neglected by
larger society. I shall also consider for each how I could personally fit in
the collective institutions that are working to tackle the problem.
