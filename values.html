<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My personal values are always changing, so I am trying to codify these here as best I can. This codification may then be used as a reference for what my actualized self could be, providing a clearer meaningful direction for my life.</p>
<p>These include some frameworks aiding thinking about how one should act, inspired by thinking on normative ethics. Also included is a directory of common value areas with my opinions on them.</p>
<h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2>
<p>Working out what I value is a difficult problem. Even just starting to think about it is a task. Thankfully, there’s been lots of thinking done in the past in the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_Ethics">normative ethics</a>. This field is concerned with exploring the question: ‘How should one act?’. How do we decide what valuable behaviour is? From summaries of the most well known works in this area, three main concepts to drive personal values presented themselves to me:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Virtues</dt>
<dd>Acting in accordance with desirable personal traits.
</dd>
<dt>Rules</dt>
<dd>Establishing and following laws of morality.
</dd>
<dt>Outcomes</dt>
<dd>Choosing actions with desirable outcomes.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each concept is interesting, full of ambiguity and should be explored.</p>
<p>Each answer also seem flawed when used wholly. If I only ever lived for outcomes and achievement, what kind of person would I become? Similarly if I always followed strict morality but never achieved anything, what would I be leaving behind?</p>
<p>When properly explored, I think each of these concepts could be used as a framework for deciding between one action or another.</p>
<h3 id="virtue-driven-values">Virtue driven values</h3>
<p>The first framework is deciding your actions based on how aligned the action is with virtues you appreciate in other people. Like not lying because you value honesty, not acting on prejudice because you value fairness or not engaging in personal attacks because you value civility.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin set up <a href="http://www.thirteenvirtues.com/">personal virtues</a> from a young age which he meticulously sought to follow. His example is an interesting one to follow, although it was made in a very different age.</p>
<p>I think there are a few traits in people which I inherently value. Some more than others. These are all things that could be used to direct my everyday actions. They have a great deal of overlap, but I think this is inevitable. So in following Franklin’s example, here are a list of my personal virtues.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="rule-driven-values">Rule driven values</h3>
<p>The second framework is basing your actions on a set of rules rather than the outcome of the actions. This binds you to the duties you need to fulfil in your life. The consequences of actions don’t make them right or wrong, but the motives of the person who caries out the action are the driving forces of ‘correct’ behaviour.</p>
<p>The arguments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanual Kant</a> are that an action is ‘good’ when it is intrinsically good without qualification, when more of the action can never make a situation ‘bad’. This discounts any virtue which anybody could state, since each virtue can be twisted to be ethically bad and an excess of a traditionally good virtue can be bad. Kant says the only thing that can be intrinsically good is a <em>good will</em>. I.e. acting in accordance with ‘some’ moral law. That you’re trying to act in ‘some’ best interest.</p>
<p>Kant’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative">Categorical Imperative</a> can help evaluate the motivations for actions. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Act only according to that Maxim whereby you can, at the same time will that it should become a universal law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way I interpret that is: don’t do something, unless you think it would be okay if everyone did it. This can go to the extreme, such as lying to a murderer about the whereabouts of their victim. Kant saw lying as universally wrong even in this situation, which I disagree with and removes lying as a universal maxim in my eyes. Very similar to ‘love thy neighbour’ in Christianity.</p>
<p>Kant also had an extra statement to add to the categorical imperative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An application of this could be to not carry out charity to make yourself feel good, but because you value the act of altruism and consider it something that you would wish upon yourself if you were in the shoes of the person it is helping. Charity not as a means to an end but as an end-in-itself, recognising it’s intrinsic value.</p>
<p>I need to explore this some more since universal laws are quite hard to think of.</p>
<h3 id="outcome-driven-values">Outcome driven values</h3>
<p>The final framework is defining a morally right act (or decision not to act) as one that will produce a good outcome or consequence. Unsurprisingly, there are many different theories as to what ‘a good outcome or consequence’ means.</p>

<h2 id="common-value-areas">Common Value Areas</h2>
<p>There’s this questionnaire in ‘<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3250347-the-happiness-trap">The Happiness Trap</a>’ by Russ Harris that cycles through some of the most common things people value and asks your position on them. It’s been helpful in getting me to apply the above frameworks directly to everyday situations, making them less abstract.</p>
<p>These cover relationships, work, personal growth and leisure.</p>
<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<p>Familial, platonic and romantic relationships.</p>
<h4 id="what-sort-of-relationships-do-you-want-to-build">What sort of relationships do you want to build?</h4>
<p>Ones that don’t just exist on the surface, that have real connection to what the other person really strives for in life. That cut at the core of what the other person really values and try to find common ground, where you can truly relate to each other.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-want-to-behave-in-these-relationships">How do you want to behave in these relationships?</h4>
<ul>
<li>To listen well and attentively.</li>
<li>To not be the main character type, be genuinely concerned about the other person.</li>
<li>To communicate clearly and without complication.</li>
<li>To be honest and forthright.</li>
<li>Accepting and understanding when the other person doesn’t behave how I would like them to.</li>
<li>Not reading too much into what isn’t there.</li>
<li>Not acting nervous about what they might say.</li>
<li>Assertive when they are being objectively abusive.</li>
<li>To make the other person feel like you’re thinking of them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-sort-of-ongoing-activities-do-you-want-to-do-with-some-of-these-people">What sort of ongoing activities do you want to do with some of these people?</h4>
<p>Chances to explore each other. Like informal trips for tea and coffee, to chat one-on-one in a more interesting manner, even if it’s somebody relatively unknown. Also more structured activities like debating clubs, baking, creative activities or other social-based games. Whilst physically separated from the person, phone calls and not so much messaging.</p>
<h3 id="workeducation">Work/Education</h3>
<p>Workplace and career. Also education and knowledge or further skills development.</p>
<h4 id="what-personal-qualities-would-you-like-to-bring-to-the-workplace">What personal qualities would you like to bring to the workplace?</h4>
<p>Productivity, helpfulness, truthfulness over compliance, curiosity, rigour, justice.</p>
<h4 id="how-would-you-behave-toward-your-colleagues-if-you-were-the-ideal-you">How would you behave toward your colleagues if you were the ‘ideal you’?</h4>
<p>Respectful of how their personal life has precedence. Being civil in any disagreement. Respectful of their background and experience. Cheerful in the face of looming situations. Openly communicating issues and shortcomings in knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="what-relationships-do-you-want-to-build-in-the-workplace-or-at-school">What relationships do you want to build in the workplace or at school?</h4>
<p>Like in my personal life, not existing completely on the surface, but digging at the root of what the person is all about. What’s their pursuit? What drives them to the same place I am?</p>
<h4 id="what-skills-knowledge-or-personal-qualities-do-you-want-to-develop">What skills, knowledge or personal qualities do you want to develop?</h4>
<p>Persuasiveness, confidence, engaging teaching, quantitative reasoning. Being well informed about making career choices.</p>
<h3 id="personal-growthhealth">Personal Growth/Health</h3>
<p>Activities that aid my ongoing development as a human-being physically, emotionally and mentally.</p>
<h4 id="what-ongoing-activities-would-you-like-to-start-or-take-up-again">What ongoing activities would you like to start or take up again?</h4>
<p>I’d like to learn languages and read foreign language books. To tackle abstract mathematical issues and teach about them. I’d like to keep my muscles strengthened. I would like to maintain therapy either with a professional or through a network of people. I want to maintain a cultivated social circle, making the most of the social connections I can make in the place where I live. I want to live in my everyday life according to the current unanimously accepted health advice.</p>
<h4 id="what-groups-or-centres-would-you-like-to-join">What groups or centres would you like to join?</h4>
<p>Maybe some kind of social welfare charity, a group of professionals, a book club, a debating club, toastmasters.</p>

<h4 id="what-sorts-of-activities-would-you-like-to-take-up-or-do-more-of">What sorts of activities would you like to take up or do more of?</h4>
<p>Maybe learn to dance and cook better. Visit art and museums, use this as spiritual guidance.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>These virtues are defined here in my words but most were inspired by particular people I’ve met in my life. Each have been so inspiring that they left a lasting impression on me. Like they changed what I value in other people due to the standard that they set. A couple have come purely from authors, many reinforced by many works of writing, but I want to stress that the majority of these came from appreciating traits in real people.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
