## Introduction

My personal values are always changing, so I am trying to codify these here as
best I can. This codification may then be used as a reference for what my
actualized self could be, providing a clearer meaningful direction for my life.

These include some frameworks aiding thinking about how one should act,
inspired by thinking on normative ethics. Also included is a directory of
common value areas with my opinions on them.


## Frameworks

Working out what I value is a difficult problem. Even just starting to think
about it is a task. Thankfully, there's been lots of thinking done in the past
in the field of [normative ethics][]. This field is concerned with exploring
the question: 'How should one act?'. How do we decide what valuable behaviour
is? From summaries of the most well known works in this area, three main
concepts to drive personal values presented themselves to me:

Virtues
: Acting in accordance with desirable personal traits.

Rules
: Establishing and following laws of morality.

Outcomes
: Choosing actions with desirable outcomes.

Each concept is interesting, full of ambiguity and should be explored.

Each answer also seem flawed when used wholly. If I only ever lived for
outcomes and achievement, what kind of person would I become? Similarly if
I always followed strict morality but never achieved anything, what would I be
leaving behind?

When properly explored, I think each of these concepts could be used as
a framework for deciding between one action or another.

### Virtue driven values

The first framework is deciding your actions based on how aligned the action is
with virtues you appreciate in other people. Like not lying because you value
honesty, not acting on prejudice because you value fairness or not engaging in
personal attacks because you value civility.

Benjamin Franklin set up [personal virtues][] from a young age which he
meticulously sought to follow. His example is an interesting one to follow,
although it was made in a very different age.

I think there are a few traits in people which I inherently value. Some more
than others. These are all things that could be used to direct my everyday
actions. They have a great deal of overlap, but I think this is inevitable. So
in following Franklin's example, here are a list of my personal virtues.[^friends]

Adventurous
: Willing to take risk, sensibly.

Altruism
: Wanting to increase other people's quality of life.

Civility
: Communicating in a way that's constructive when conflict arises.

Fairness
: Giving everybody a chance, not succumbing to prejudice.

Focus
: Understanding that attempting to solve every problem at once is a great way
to solve none of them.

Growth
: Always wanting to be a better person within their context.

Health
: Being physically well functioning.

Honesty
: Being transparent in actions, motivations and feelings without brutality.

Humility
: Never assuming personal superiority in all areas or without evidence.

Mindfulness
: Not suppressing emotions, but also not over-reacting to them.

Pragmatism
: Not irrationally pursuing perfection, but also not remaining complacent with
mediocrity.

Rationality
: Not succumbing to dogma or crowd mentality, applying reason sensibly.

Reliability
: Being there when needed most with the people they value most.

Respect
: Giving due weight to those perceived to have greater experiences.

Self-sufficiency
: Looking after themselves.

Sociability
: Being proactive in bringing people together.

[^friends]: These virtues are defined here in my words but most were inspired
by particular people I've met in my life. Each have been so inspiring that
they left a lasting impression on me. Like they changed what I value in other
people due to the standard that they set. A couple have come purely from
authors, many reinforced by many works of writing, but I want to stress that
the majority of these came from appreciating traits in real people.

### Rule driven values

The second framework is basing your actions on a set of rules rather than the
outcome of the actions. This binds you to the duties you need to fulfil in your
life. The consequences of actions don't make them right or wrong, but the
motives of the person who caries out the action are the driving forces of
'correct' behaviour.

The arguments of [Immanual Kant][] are that an action is 'good' when it is
intrinsically good without qualification, when more of the action can never
make a situation 'bad'. This discounts any virtue which anybody could state,
since each virtue can be twisted to be ethically bad and an excess of a
traditionally good virtue can be bad. Kant says the only thing that can be
intrinsically good is a *good will*. I.e. acting in accordance with 'some'
moral law. That you're trying to act in 'some' best interest.

Kant's [Categorical Imperative][] can help evaluate the motivations for actions. It reads:

> Act only according to that Maxim whereby you can, at the same time will that
> it should become a universal law.

The way I interpret that is: don't do something, unless you think it would be
okay if everyone did it. This can go to the extreme, such as lying to a
murderer about the whereabouts of their victim. Kant saw lying as universally
wrong even in this situation, which I disagree with and removes lying as a
universal maxim in my eyes. Very similar to 'love thy neighbour' in
Christianity.

Kant also had an extra statement to add to the categorical imperative:

> Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in
> the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the
> same time as an end.

An application of this could be to not carry out charity to make yourself feel
good, but because you value the act of altruism and consider it something that
you would wish upon yourself if you were in the shoes of the person it is
helping. Charity not as a means to an end but as an end-in-itself, recognising
it's intrinsic value.

I need to explore this some more since universal laws are quite hard to think
of.

### Outcome driven values

The final framework is defining a morally right act (or decision not to act) as
one that will produce a good outcome or consequence. Unsurprisingly, there are
many different theories as to what 'a good outcome or consequence' means.

[Utilitarianism][]
: The greatest social benefit for the greatest number of people.

[State consequentialism][]
: Produces the greatest value for the state you live
in (Confuscious inspired).

[Egoism][]
: The greatest social benefit or gratification for yourself.

[Situational ethics][]
: The greatest amount unconditional love is created.

[Intellectualism][]
: The greatest amount of knowledge is created or retained,
regardless of its use.

[Welfarism][]
: Improves the economic welfare of the greater number of people.

[Preference utilitarianism][]
: Personally satisfies the greatest number of
people according to their own wishes.

[Role ethics][]
: The outcome that is most aligned with your assigned role in
your community or society.

## Common Value Areas

There's this questionnaire in '[The Happiness Trap][]' by Russ Harris that
cycles through some of the most common things people value and asks your
position on them. It's been helpful in getting me to apply the above frameworks
directly to everyday situations, making them less abstract.

These cover relationships, work, personal growth and leisure.

### Relationships

Familial, platonic and romantic relationships.

#### What sort of relationships do you want to build?

Ones that don't just exist on the surface, that have real connection to what
the other person really strives for in life. That cut at the core of what the
other person really values and try to find common ground, where you can truly
relate to each other.

#### How do you want to behave in these relationships?

* To listen well and attentively.
* To not be the main character type, be genuinely concerned about the other person.
* To communicate clearly and without complication.
* To be honest and forthright.
* Accepting and understanding when the other person doesn't behave how I would like them to.
* Not reading too much into what isn't there.
* Not acting nervous about what they might say.
* Assertive when they are being objectively abusive.
* To make the other person feel like you're thinking of them.

#### What sort of ongoing activities do you want to do with some of these people?

Chances to explore each other. Like informal trips for tea and coffee, to chat
one-on-one in a more interesting manner, even if it's somebody relatively
unknown.  Also more structured activities like debating clubs, baking, creative
activities or other social-based games. Whilst physically separated from the
person, phone calls and not so much messaging.

### Work/Education

Workplace and career. Also education and knowledge or further skills
development.

#### What personal qualities would you like to bring to the workplace?
Productivity, helpfulness, truthfulness over compliance, curiosity, rigour,
justice.

#### How would you behave toward your colleagues if you were the 'ideal you'?

Respectful of how their personal life has precedence. Being civil in any
disagreement. Respectful of their background and experience. Cheerful in the
face of looming situations. Openly communicating issues and shortcomings in
knowledge.

#### What relationships do you want to build in the workplace or at school?

Like in my personal life, not existing completely on the surface, but digging
at the root of what the person is all about. What's their pursuit? What drives
them to the same place I am?

#### What skills, knowledge or personal qualities do you want to develop?

Persuasiveness, confidence, engaging teaching, quantitative reasoning. Being
well informed about making career choices.

### Personal Growth/Health

Activities that aid my ongoing development as a human-being physically,
emotionally and mentally.

#### What ongoing activities would you like to start or take up again?

I'd like to learn languages and read foreign language books. To tackle abstract
mathematical issues and teach about them. I'd like to keep my muscles
strengthened. I would like to maintain therapy either with a professional or
through a network of people. I want to maintain a cultivated social circle,
making the most of the social connections I can make in the place where I live.
I want to live in my everyday life according to the current unanimously
accepted health advice.

#### What groups or centres would you like to join?

Maybe some kind of social welfare charity, a group of professionals, a book
club, a debating club, toastmasters.

### Leisure

How I play, relax or enjoy myself. Sports, hobbies, arts, etc.

#### How do you wish to relax or have fun in a healthy, life-enhancing way?

Dating, reading and exploring. Hanging out with close family and friends.

#### What sorts of activities would you like to take up or do more of?

Maybe learn to dance and cook better. Visit art and museums, use this as
spiritual guidance.
