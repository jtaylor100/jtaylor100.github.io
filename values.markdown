## Introduction

My values are always changing, so I am trying to codify these here as best I
can. These include some frameworks aiding thinking about how one should act.
Also included is a directory of recurring value areas with my opinions on them.


## Frameworks

Working out what I value is a difficult problem. Wikipedia has an
article on [normative ethics][] which gives some ideas for how I should decide
to act:

- Acting in accordance with desirable traits.
- Establishing and following common laws of morality.
- Aiming for actions with desirable outcomes.

Each is interesting, full of ambiguity (like what does 'desirable' mean to me?)
and should be explored. I don't think basing my life completely on one of these
is realistic since they all seem flawed when used wholly. A mixture would be
best.

### Virtue driven values

Deciding your actions based on how aligned the action
is with your ideal character traits. Like not lying because you value honesty,
not acting on prejudice because you value fairness or not engaging in personal
attacks because you value civility. Benjamin Franklin set up [personal
virtues][] from a young age which he meticulously sought to follow.

I think there are a few traits in people which I inherently value. Some more
than others. These are all things that could be used to direct my everyday
actions. These are sorted in my personal feeling of 'importance'.

Altruism
: Wanting to increase other people's quality of life.

Civility
: Communicating in a way that's constructive when conflict arises.

Fairness
: Giving everybody a chance, not succumbing to prejudice.

Focus
: Trying to solve every problem is a great way to solve none of them.

Growth
: Always wanting to be a better person within their context.

Health
: Being well functioning.

Honesty
: Being transparent in actions, motivations and feelings without brutality.

Humility
: Never assuming personal superiority in all areas or without evidence.

Mindfulness
: Not suppressing emotions, but also not over-reacting to them.

Pragmatism
: Not irrationally pursuing perfection, but also not acceptant of mediocrity.

Rationality
: Not succumbing to dogma or crowd mentality, applying reason sensibly.

Reliability
: Being there when needed most with the people you value most.

Respect
: Giving due weight to those perceived to have greater experiences.

Self-sufficiency
: Looking after yourself.

### Rule driven values

Your actions should be decided based on a set of rules rather than the outcome
of the actions. This binds you to the duties you need to fulfil in your life.
The consequences of actions don't make them right or wrong, but the motives of
the person who caries out the action.

The arguments of [Kant][] are that an action is 'good' when it is intrinsically
good without and qualification, when more of the action can never make a
situation 'bad'. This discounts any virtue which anybody could state, since
each virtue can be twisted to be ethically bad and an excess of a traditionally
good virtue can be bad. Kant says the only thing that can be intrinsically good
is a *good will*. I.e. acting in accordance with 'some' moral law. That you're
trying to act in 'some' best interest.

Kant's [Categorical Imperative][] can help evaluate the motivations for actions. It reads:

> Act only according to that Maxim whereby you can, at the same time will that
> it should become a universal law.

The way I interpret that is "don't do something, unless you wish it were done
by everyone". This can go to the extreme, such as lying to a murderer about the
whereabouts of their victim. Kant saw lying as universally wrong even in this
situation, which I disagree with and removes lying as a universal maxim in my
eyes. Very similar to 'love thy neighbour' in Christianity.

Kant also had an extra statement to add to the categorical imperative:

> Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in
> the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the
> same time as an end.

An application of this could be to not carry out charity to make yourself feel
good, but because you value the act of altruism and consider it something that
you would wish upon yourself if you were in the shoes of the person it is
helping. Charity not as a means to an end but as an end-in-itself, recognising
it's intrinsic value.

I can think of some other Maxims which I will to be universal laws:

#### Eat only when you are hungry

I.e. don't waste resources on yourself for petty or compulsive reasons. Make
sure everything you spend has meaning behind it.

### Outcome driven values

A morally right act (or decision not to act) is one
that will produce a good outcome or consequence. There are many different
theories as to what 'a good outcome or consequence' means. [Utilitarianism][]
by Bentham, [State consequentialism][] where something is valuable if it's
valuable to the state (Confuscious inspired),
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism][Egoism]] which Ayn Rand likes
where the most moral person is the self-interested person,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_ethics][situational ethics]] where
love is maximised,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectualism][intellectualism]] where
knowledge as an end-in-itself is maximised,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfarism][Welfarism]] which maximises economic
welfare, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism][preference
utilitarianism]] where the most valued action is the one that satisfies the
most people and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_ethics][role ethics]]
where your values are decided by your role in the community you live in.

## Common Value Areas

There's this questionnaire in 'The Happiness Trap' that cycles through some of
the most common things people value and asks your position on them. This is my
output.

Relationships, personal growth and health. In particular the relationships with my family, my personal growth as a moral individual and maintaining myself as a well-functioning person. I also value having my work tied to something I intrinsically value.

### Relationships

Familial, friendly and romantic relationships.

#### What sort of relationships do you want to build?

Ones that don't just exist on the surface, that have real connection to what
the other person really strives for in life. That cut at the core of what the
other person really values and try to find common ground, where you can truly
relate to each other.

#### How do you want to behave in these relationships?

* To listen well and attentively.
* To not be the main character type, be genuinely concerned about the other person.
* To communicate clearly and without complication.
* To be honest and forthright.
* Accepting and understanding when the other person doesn't behave how I would like them to.
* Not reading too much into what isn't there.
* Not acting nervous about what they might say.
* Assertive when they are being objectively abusive.
* To make the other person feel like you're thinking of them.

#### What sort of ongoing activities do you want to do with some of these people?

Chances to explore each other. Like informal trips for tea and coffee,to chat
one-on-one in a more interesting manner, even if it's somebody relatively
unknown.  Also more structured environment like debating clubs, baking or other
social-based games. Whilst physically separated from the person, phone calls
and not so much messaging.

### Work/Education

Workplace and career, education and knowledge or further skills development.

#### What personal qualities would you like to bring to the workplace?
Productivity, helpfulness, truthfulness over compliance, curiosity, rigour,
justice.

#### How would you behave toward your colleagues if you were the 'ideal you'?

Respectful of how their personal life has precedence. Being civil in any
disagreement. Respectful of their background and experience. Cheerful in the
face of looming situations. Openly communicating issues and shortcomings in
knowledge.

#### What relationships do you want to build in the workplace or at school?

Like in my personal live, not existing completely on the surface, but digging
at the root of what the person is all about. What's their pursuit? What drives
them to the same place I am?

#### What skills, knowledge or personal qualities do you want to develop?

Persuasiveness, confidence, engaging teaching, quantitative reasoning. Being
well informed about making career choices.

### Personal Growth/Health

Activities that aid my ongoing development as a human-being physically,
emotionally and mentally.

#### What ongoing activities would you like to start or take up again?

I'd like to learn languages and read foreign language books. To tackle abstract
mathematical issues and teach about them. I'd like to keep my muscles
strengthened. I would like to maintain therapy either with a professional or
through a network of people. I want to maintain a cultivated social circle,
making the most of the social connections I can make in the place where I live.
I want to live in my everyday life according to the current unanimously
accepted health advice.

#### What groups or centres would you like to join?

Maybe some kind of social welfare charity, a group of professionals, a book
club, a debating club, toastmasters.

### Leisure

How I play, relax or enjoy myself. Sports, hobbies, arts, etc.

#### How do you wish to relax or have fun in a healthy, life-enhancing way?

Dating, reading and exploring. Hanging out with close family and friends.

#### What sorts of activities would you like to take up or do more of?

Maybe learn to dance and cook better. Visit art and museums, use this as
spiritual guidance.
